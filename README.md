# langstudio-server

LangStudio is a fullstack web application, designed to support students following a foreign language course, such as given at a community college (Volksuniversiteit in the Netherlands). At present it is geared toward Dutch-speaking students following an Indonesian language course, but the application itself is language-agnostic.
